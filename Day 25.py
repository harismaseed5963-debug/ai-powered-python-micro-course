# Learning Python - Day 25
# 1. Advanced Filtering In Pandas
# 2. Sorting Data Advanced Level

#  Practical Exercise Of The Day 25
# # DAY 25 – ADVANCED PANDAS (GroupBy, Filtering, Sorting)


# import pandas as pd

# Load cleaned employee data
# df = pd.read_csv("day24_Employee_Data.csv")

# print("\n--- Data Loaded ---")
# print(df.head())


# # FILTERING

# Employees from Mumbai
# df["City"]=df["City"].str.strip().str.title()
# mumbai_emp = df[df["City"] == "Mumbai"]
# print(mumbai_emp)

# # High salary employees
# high_salary = df[df["Salary"] > 60000]
# print(high_salary)


# Multiple conditions
# mumbai_high = df[(df["City"] == "Mumbai") & (df["Salary"] > 60000)]
# print(mumbai_high)

# mumbai_pune = df[(df["City"] == "Mumbai") | (df["City"] == "Pune")] 
# print(mumbai_pune)


# Using isin()
# IT_and_Finance=df[df["Department"].isin(["IT","Finance"])]
# print(IT_and_Finance)

# # Advance Sorting

# Sort by Salary descending
# df_sorted_salary = df.sort_values("Salary", ascending=False)

# Sort by Department then Salary
# df_sorted_multi = df.sort_values(["Department", "Salary"], ascending=[True, False])
# print(df_sorted_multi)


# # GROUP BY OPERATIONS

# # Average salary by department
# avg_salary_dept = df.groupby("Department")["Salary"].mean()
# print(avg_salary_dept)

# # Total salary by city
# total_salary_city = df.groupby("City")["Salary"].sum()

# # Employee count by department
# emp_count_dept = df.groupby("Department")["Employee_ID"].count()

# # Multiple aggregations
# salary_stats = df.groupby("Department")["Salary"].agg(["min", "max", "mean", "count"])

# print("\nSalary Stats:")
# print(salary_stats)

# # SORT GROUPBY RESULT

# sorted_avg_salary = avg_salary_dept.sort_values(ascending=False)
# print("\nDepartments by Avg Salary:")
# print(sorted_avg_salary)
